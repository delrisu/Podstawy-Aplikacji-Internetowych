          Spice & Wolf is a combination of genres that somehow brings out the
          best of all it's elements. It's a low fantasy set in a medieval
          style world, where the magic that does exist is relatively small and
          far between; basically Holo, a harvet goddess, is the only thing
          that would set this story apart from a more plain historical
          setting.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had watched the first season of the anime and while that's
          actually a quite good adaptation and a lot of fun; it simply can't
          fully do the story justice. The verbal sparing and internal
          calculations and decisions that Lawrence makes are much more
          apparent on the written page; and serve to deepen the connection
          that he and Holo are developing.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the first several volumes do deal a good bit with certain
          aspects of commerce; this ends up setting the stage not just for
          Lawrence's personality and state of mind; but also helps expand on
          the world the story takes place in (it's pretty cold and cruel in
          many respects).
        </p>
        <p>
          The writing and translation are clear, and in places practically
          lyrical. You have a blend of low fantasy, the early buds of a
          potential romance, and a commerce deal gone bad. There are no
          dragons threatening to destroy towns, nor mighty army's clashing.
          Instead you have the a story that simply does some quite world
          building by way of the characters interactions and relationships.
